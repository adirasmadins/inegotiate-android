## Synopsis

iNegotiate is an Android Application that provides an advanced platform for a buyer and a seller to negotiate the price of a product, service, or experience in a convenient and a discrete manner.

## Motivation

Many people ask me "why do I need iNegotiate?" or: "How can iNegotiate help me?". It's pretty simple actually: 
Say you walk into your favorite clothing store, and you see an awesome sweater, that looks absolutely perfect!.
But the problem is -it costs too much.  Had the price been a bit lower - you would have purchased it, but at 
the current price,  it is simply not possible.

Are you able to go to the store owner and ask them to drop the price? They would probably laugh you out of the 
store or suggest other product that are in your price range - but really what you wanted.

Can you negotiate for a better price? Sure you can! but the problem is that there might be other people in the 
store and if the store owner drops the price for you, s/he might be forced to do that for other clients as 
well - not the best position to be in! Ultimately the store owner will politely refuse

So what can you do?  You need a discrete and an efficient way to bargain for the price of the sweater?
That's where iNegotiate comes in
